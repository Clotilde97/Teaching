When we use negative numbers we are indexing the list from the end, rather than the front. We can also ask for a part of a list in a range. This is called 'slicing'. Finally, if we are working with characters, we can chop up a string into a list, or take a list and join it together as a string. You can index a list using the []. To slice a list, you would use the : inside the []. Lets try an example where we get a single indexed return and a slice:"

If a collection is unordered python will not necessarily give you the elements in the order that they were created. The ordering is actually related to how they are stored in memory and so it could change at any point. The main way to iterate through a collection is to use the infamous *for loop*.

    "There are two important things to note here: First, we *absolutely need* the colon at the end of the opening line. Secondly, note the indentation. In Python, whitespace is used to denote blocks (in other langauges, brackets or braces are used). ```def```, ```if```, ```elif```, ```else```, ```try```, ```except```, ```finally```, ```with```, ```for```, ```while```, and ```class``` all start blocks. Some of these we will see more of in this course. To end the indentation, we just 'outdent' (i.e. go back to where we were before the block began). An ident can either be 4 spaces or a tab. People have very [heated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/119562/tabs-versus-spaces-in-python-programming) discussions about [which to use](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/), but at this level, either is fine. Put simply: this indentation is how python manages what is inside a loop and what is after the loop. What happens if we dont intent, or dont include the colon?"

Once you know how to evaluate a statement you can use this evaluation to control the flow in a program. For example, we might say do something if a statement is true and then do something else if another statement applies (This is Boolean logic: a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either TRUE or FALSE). Python uses two equals signs to mean 'test for equality'. This is not the only way things evaluate to true, but it is the most common one. *Note that a single equals sign signals assignment, not a test for equality*!
