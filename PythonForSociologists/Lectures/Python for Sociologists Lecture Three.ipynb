To make something more abstract is to articulate or encode some phenomenon in a form that is less contingent or specific. If we can discern the commonalities between different cases, we can apply the same logic in a number of cases.\n",
    "The functional purpose of programming is typically to transform particular cases into more general ones. Instead of renaming every photo in a set of vacation photos, we can append \"Vacation2016_\" to all of them. In a broader sense, we are trying to automate or abstract tasks with computers in order to play to their strengths for speed and accuracy.\n",
