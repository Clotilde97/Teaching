    "Welcome! This is the first of four lectures in the module. For introductory information outlining the class, please see the README.md file in the [Github repository](https://github.com/crahal/Teaching/tree/master/PythonForSociologists). In this very introductory lecture we will cover primative data types (characters and numbers) and introduce various types of object. Without getting ahead of ourselves, we can note at this early stage that in Python, everything is an object, and that it is an object-oriented language (although not a 'pure' one)."

It has 128 code points. The first 38 are control characters, like 'new line', and the remainder are the upper and lower case alphabet, ten digits and punctuation characters.

If you want to reference the emoji in python, you'll need to know the unicode codepoints. You can print emoji, but not really do much else with it. This is because some emoji are actually two characters. I mention emoji only to highlight that you don't need to strip your text right down to ASCII to work with it anymore, and this opens up new research questions. It's also great for pictographic langauges such as Chinese, which is now far easier to deal with in Python 3."

    "#### 2.4.1. Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "In python the + symbol means concatenate when it appears between two strings. This is the simplest way to combine two strings. Here are some ways to concatenate. Try them out, but dont forget the whitespace if necessary:\n",

    "\n",
    "Virtually every programming language has a notion of a collection. A collection is a means for referring to one or more things at the same time, and Python has many collection types (note: a string can be thought of as a joined up list of characters). In general, collections are iterable, which means that you can ask for each item in the collection one-by-one. But beyond that they vary quite dramatically. Here are the major collection *types* that you will come across in Python:\n",
