    "You are expected to at least attempt all of the ten questions below. Again, while this isn't a pass/fail course, your progression to OII modules requires that you submit *something*. Beacuse there are slightly fewer, longer questions here, each question carries an equal weight of THREE points. If you get the correct answer, you recieve 3 points, if you have a very good attempt, you'll get 2, a less good attempt will get 1, and a shoddy or non-attempt will get nil. Notebooks will be returned via email with feedback."
