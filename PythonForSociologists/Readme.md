# Python for Sociologists
---

This is the repository for teaching Python for Sociologists at the Department of Sociology, University of Oxford. It contains all of the information that you will need about the course, as there will be no print-outs. Please check back here on a regular basis! This repo will be updated week by week as the class progresses, with updates determined by the speed of progress.

### Who/When

This course is aimed at graduate students in sociology who are taking electives with Python as a pre-requisite. Later iterations of the course will more generally target graduate students who are looking to use Python in their research. The course will take place in the Large Discussion Room at 15.00-17.00 every Friday from 10th November to 1st December (inclusive: i.e. 4 weeks of 2 hours per week). The lectures will last between 90 and 120 minutes.

### Assignments

Assignments are *mandatory*. I cannot emphasize this enough. There is no pass or fail for the course, but if you want to progress for electives at the OII in particular, you will have to submit (i.e. -- at least attempt) each of the 4 assignments and submit them to me by email on Tuesday at 5pm following the class. You should submit the assignments as iPython Notebooks (see below), and I will return them to you by email with feedback in advance of the next class. The assignments are hosted in the Homeworks subdirectory of this repository.

### Installation

It is critical that you have installed Python (and specifically: Juypter Notebooks) on a laptop that you bring to the class to follow along. We *strongly, strongly* advocate using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution to install Python and Jupyter jointly. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages (Pandas, Numpy, etc.) for scientific computing and data science. Jupyter is an interface designed for scientific computing, providing a way to link text, code and code output in one document. It is available for Windows, Linux and macOS. If you have absolutely any problems installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) in advance of the first class, *please email me as a priority*. To check that Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly, type:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
in your command prompt/terminal.

### Lectures

You can find the lectures stored in the *Lectures* subdirectory of this repository. There are no slides, as the classes will be led from the notebooks. The notebooks are predominantly based on those used by the magnanimous Bernie Hogan to teach introductory Python to OII students (the homeworks are almost identical, to create parity with students entering his module from other angles). The material covered includes:

1. Primitive data types
2. Strings
3. Collections
4. Iterating over a collection
5. Boolean logic and control statements
6. More on loops
7. User input and error handling
8. Pseudocode
9. Functions
10. Reading Files
11. Writing Files
12. Programming outside Jupyter

### Additional resources

There is an exorbitant amount of material out there related to learning python from scratch. Some guides focus on audiences with some existing programming expertise in other language, and some focus on those with no experience at all. Googling 'Learn Python' will bring up a number of online courses, free e-books, etc. One particularly popular resource is  [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). In terms of textbooks, Bernie recommends [Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036). However, I personally recommend the Coursera Specialisation [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) taught by Charles Severance and the associated textbook [Python for Informatics: Exploring Information](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Informatics-Dr-Charles-Severance/dp/1492339245). The main Q&A style forum that most programmers rely heavily on is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-3.x).
