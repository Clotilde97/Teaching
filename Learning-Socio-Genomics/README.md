# Learning-Socio-Genomics

A set of lecture notes, notebooks, functions (mostly Python and R) and methological summaries on the topic of (socio-)genomics. In particular, it will eventually contain:

1. A [glossary](https://github.com/crahal/Learning-Socio-Genomics/tree/master/Glossary) of commonly used terms which may be useful for non-geneticists coming towards this discipline.

2. [A set of notes](https://github.com/crahal/Learning-Socio-Genomics/tree/master/Genomic%20Data%20Science) relating to the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) specialisation on Coursera.

3. A [set of notes](https://github.com/crahal/Learning-Socio-Genomics/tree/master/GWAS) specifically focused on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or genomic-wide association meta analyses (GWAMA).

4. A [set of notes](https://github.com/crahal/Learning-Socio-Genomics/tree/master/PGS) specifically relating to polygenic scores (PGS) and their construction.

5. A [list of useful softwares](https://github.com/crahal/Learning-Socio-Genomics/tree/master/Useful%20Software) to reduce the programming burdens.

6. A [set of notes](https://github.com/crahal/Learning-Socio-Genomics/tree/master/NCRMSummerSchool) related to the forthcoming NCRM Summer School.
