## [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science)

This is a set of notes relating to the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) specialisation on Coursera. If you are considering taking just one or two of these modules, the [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing) module taught by [Ben Langmead](https://github.com/BenLangmead/comp-genomics-class) is **especially** good. A couple of other notes: i.) don't expect to have an easy time completing the Genomic Data Science with Galaxy project with just the training given in the lectures, and ii.) for the Command Line tools module, it's really advisible to VM the CentOS distro they provide, as if you use a different distro and install more modern/different versions of the packages, the quiz solution choices dont match up.

The notes are written in the .tex [template](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/10725-F12/template.tex) borrowed from CS267, Applications of Parallel Computing at the UCBerkeley EECS Department. Embedded code highlighting (for appropriate R and Python functions) comes from [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted), and is then compiled with XeLateX. The courses are:

1. [Introduction to Genomic Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-genomics)
2. [Genomic Data Science with Galaxy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project)
3. [Python for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-genomics)
4. [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing)
5. [Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genomic-tools)
6. [Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioconductor)
7. [Statistics for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-genomics)
