## An Introduction to the Command Line

A set of files related to teaching a very basic introduction to *nix-like systems course. The apples.genes and apple.genome file come from the [Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genomic-tools) course by Liliana Florea, with infographics from [SmudgeThis](http://www.smudgethis.com/).
