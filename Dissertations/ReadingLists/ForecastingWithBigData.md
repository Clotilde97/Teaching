## A Preliminary Set of Notes for the Dissertation Topic: *Forecasting with 'Big Data’*

This is a basic guide to both the resources required and the required reading list for MSc Dissertation Topic number 102. While not exhaustive by any means, it provides a guide to the most useful tools and practices according to relevant practice in both the private sector and academia. It also has a couple of references to forecasting with Confidence Indicators, which might be useful in case you wanted to take
an approach approach which utilizes smaller data, albeit still within a ‘model averaging’/selection framework.

### Time Series Textbooks

There are a number of textbooks which might be useful. Very introductory textbooks which might be useful are [Brooks (2015) – Introductory Econometrics for Finance](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introductory-Econometrics-Finance-Chris-Brooks/dp/052169468X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) or [Stock and Watson (2013) – Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Econometrics-James-H-Stock-x/dp/1292071311/). A more encyclopedic time series textbook is [Hamilton (1993) – Time Series Analysis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Analysis-James-D-Hamilton/dp/9380663439/). You could also look at [Lutkepol (2007) – Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Introduction-Multiple-Time-Analysis/dp/3540262393), and if that is too
difficult, consider [Enders (2004) – Applied Econometric Time Series](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Applied-Time-Econometrics-Themes-Modern/dp/0521547873/).

### Software Tools

You have three main options when it comes to Econometric Software (discounting RATS, which remains a valid option, although is less used in the modern era). The first, simplest, accessible choice is EViews. This is most suitable if you want to do more conventional econometric forecasting. The key resource for this are the [EViews forum](http://forums.eviews.com/). You can also find my notes for EViews workshop [here](https://github.com/crahal/Teaching/tree/master/Dissertations/EViewsWorkshop). There is also an EViews textbook available for [free](http://www.eviews.com/illustrated/illustrated.html). A more advanced choice is [MATLAB](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/) (with accompanying notes [here](https://github.com/crahal/Teaching/tree/master/Dissertations/MatlabWorkshop)). For MATLAB, there are two main textbooks which are worth reading. The first is by [John Frain](https://ideas.repec.org/p/tcd/tcduee/tep0414.html) and the second is by [ames LeSage](www.spatial-econometrics.com/html/mbook.pdf). If you are feeling ambitious, feel free to use Python, and a truly great introductory textbook for Econometrics and Statistics by [Kevin Sheppard](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/09/Python_introduction.pdf.) is also available for free.

### Data

There are two obvious choices/approaches when it comes to datasets. The first is to construct your own dataset - tailed to the specific approach which you want to take. This could involve creating a macropanel from the very large [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) portal. The alternate 'off the shelf' dataset is [FRED-MD](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/), constructed by Michael W. McCracken and described in [McCracken and Ng (2016)](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350015.2015.1086655?journalCode=ubes20).

### ARIMA Benchmarks

Regardless of your approach, you should consider an ARIMA benchmark (even if it is only an AR(4) model) as an essential way of validating your forecasting approach. The absolute standard reference for this type of technique is [Hyndman and Khandakar (2008)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v027i03) and the associated R package that goes with it. There are both EViews [add-ons](http://forums.eviews.com/viewtopic.php?t=2124) and [in-built](http://www.eviews.com/help/helpintro.html#page/content/series-Automatic_ARIMA_Forecasting.html) features to replicate this type of benchmark.

### Confidence Indicators

There are a lot of recent papers on using Confidence/Sentiment Indicators for forecasting financial markets. Early examples include [Mourougane and Roma (2002)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp133.pdf?7f9fcb71c9a79e446251a79273c9ba60) and [Batchelora and Duab (1998)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207097000526).Other notable examples include [Banerjee, Marcellino and Masten (2005)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0084.2005.00141.x/full) and [Stock and Watons (2003)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2184936). There also applications in specific fields, such as real estate, like [An de Muelen et al. (2014)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09599916.2014.940059).

### Big Data Forecasting

The first Big Data method which you might consider is a combination based approach, such as [Banternghans and McCracken (2011)](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2011/01/03/real-time-forecast-averaging-with-alfred/) or [Rahal and Barassi (2017)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2583826). The second approach to consider (and by far the most popular in the literature) most useful Dynamic Factor Models. This literature is vast, but is mostly based upon the Static Factors approach of [Stock and Watson (2002)](https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/Stock_Watson_JBES_2002.pdf). This methodology extends in many directions, such as a systems based approaches with cointegration, as in [Banerjee et al. (2014)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207013000368). The final broader type of approach is Bayesian, and involves methods such as [Banbura et al. (2009)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp966.pdf?bde67191add82abdf8703c77772d9e45), and code by [Gary Koop](http://personal.strath.ac.uk/gary.koop/) and [Dimitris Korobilis](https://sites.google.com/site/dimitriskorobilis/matlab). An extremely interesting, and yet largely unexplored topic is that of 'targetted predictors', as per [Bai and Ng (2008)](http://www.columbia.edu/~sn2294/pub/target.pdf) and [Fosten (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/for.2429/full#references).
